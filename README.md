I have created this game as a project for our subject Introduction to Programming, M14. This is a arcade Space Invaders-like 1v1 game made with pygame. Except for the music we have created everything else ourselves. I would like to say thanks to my amazing teacher XaSaFa for helping me in my jurney.
